# CCPROG1_TurnBasedTiledShooter

Tile-based shooters are shooting games where the player's movement is restricted to specific spaces. The user is the player and the player can either move left, or right, or shoot every turn. After the player makes a move, the enemyâ€™s turn begins and they can move based on a simple pattern.
