# CCPROG1_TurnBasedTiledShooter

Game Mechanics.
  Tile-based shooters are shooting games where the player's movement is restricted to specific spaces. For this project, the user is the player and the player can either move left, or right, or shoot every turn. After the player makes a move, the enemyâ€™s turn begins and they can move based on a simple pattern. To simplify the movement, both enemies and the player will move in a simple tile-based manner. There are 4 columns that the player and enemies can move from. The enemy has 5 rows they can move down from. The player can only move horizontally and will move one tile per movement. Firing the laser will destroy only one enemy in the same column. The player cannot move and fire the laser on the same turn. Whenever an enemy is defeated, the player scores 10 points. Enemies spawn from the top of the map and will move right, down, left, and down in a cycle. When the player reaches a score of 100 points, the player has won. Otherwise, If the enemies reach the bottom of the map, the player has lost.
