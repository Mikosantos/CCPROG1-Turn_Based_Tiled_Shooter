üìù**About**:   
   - Tile-based shooters are shooting games where the player's movement is restricted to specific spaces. 
   - For this project, the user is the player and the player can either move left, or right, or shoot every turn. 
   - After the player makes a move, the enemy‚Äôs turn begins and they can move based on a simple pattern. 
   - To simplify the movement, both enemies and the player will move in a simple tile-based manner. There are 4 columns that the player and enemies can move from. The enemy has 5 rows they can move down from. 
   - The player can only move horizontally and will move one tile per movement. 
   - Firing the laser will destroy only one enemy in the same column. The player cannot move and fire the laser on the same turn. 
   - Whenever an enemy is defeated, the player scores 10 points. Enemies spawn from the top of the map and will move right, down, left, and down in a cycle. When the player reaches a score of 100 points, the player has won. Otherwise, If the enemies reach the bottom of the map, the player has lost.


üíª**To run**:

   - Download any IDE; VsCode or DevC++ suffice.
   - Download, install, and run gcc compiler. There are many tutorial on the how-tos on YouTube. 
   - Use "gcc -Wall mp.c -o run.exe" for Windows
